Protocol4
===

Protocol4 is a bridge mod between 1.7.10 clients (protocol 5) to 1.7.2/4/5 servers (protocol 4).
To join a protocol 4 server, open the multiplayer menu and click the [1.7.10] button on the
bottom of the screen. It will change to 1.7.5 and refresh the server list. If you can't remember
what versions are compatible with others, the button text will cycle through the supported
versions while hovered.
